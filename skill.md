# Pencil Prototyping

Prototype visuals on a Pencil.dev canvas — on demand, from any conversation.

## Step 1: Ensure Pencil is Ready

Run the startup script:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/pencil-prototyping/bin/pencil-start.sh
```

**Interpret exit codes:**
- **Exit 0** — Pencil is installed and running. Continue to Step 2.
- **Exit 1** — Something failed (download, timeout). Show the error output to the user and stop.
- **Exit 2** — First-time install. Tell the user:
  > Pencil has been installed. Please:
  > 1. Activate with your email in the Pencil window
  > 2. Go to Settings → Agents and MCP → enable Claude Code
  > 3. Confirm when done

  After user confirms, invoke the `restart` skill to restart Claude Code for MCP connection.

## Step 2: Check MCP Connection

After Step 1 succeeds (exit 0), check if Pencil MCP tools are available by calling:

```
mcp__pencil__get_editor_state
```

- **If it works** — MCP is connected. Continue to Step 3.
- **If it errors** — Pencil is running but MCP isn't connected (CC was started before Pencil). Tell the user:
  > Pencil is running but MCP isn't connected yet. Restarting Claude Code to establish the connection.

  Invoke the `restart` skill.

## Step 3: Create or Open Canvas

Parse the user's arguments:
- `<topic>` — the subject of the prototype (e.g., "login-flow", "dashboard")
- `--path=<dir>` — custom output directory (default: `docs/designs/` in current project)
- `--open=<file.pen>` — open an existing .pen file instead of creating new

**For new canvas:**
1. Create the output directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p <path>`
2. Call `mcp__pencil__open_document` with `filePathOrTemplate: "new"`
3. Note: the .pen file will be saved by the user in Pencil (File → Save As to `<path>/<topic>.pen`)

**For existing file:**
1. Call `mcp__pencil__open_document` with `filePathOrTemplate: "<absolute-path>"`

## Step 4: Prototype

Now use the Pencil MCP tools to design:

1. **Get design guidelines** — call `get_guidelines` with the relevant topic (`landing-page`, `design-system`, `web-app`, `mobile-app`, etc.)
2. **Get style guide** — call `get_style_guide_tags` then `get_style_guide` with relevant tags for visual direction
3. **Get available components** — call `batch_get` with `patterns: [{ reusable: true }]` to see what components are available
4. **Design** — use `batch_design` to create shapes, insert components, update properties
5. **Verify** — call `get_screenshot` periodically to verify the design looks correct
6. **Iterate** — ask the user for feedback, make adjustments

## Step 5: Capture

When the user is satisfied with the prototype:

1. Call `get_screenshot` for the final state
2. Tell the user where the .pen file and screenshot are saved
3. Suggest: "You can continue editing in Pencil, or I can make more changes."

## Conductor Integration

This skill is available at any point in any pipeline. During explore/shape phases, proactively offer:
> I can prototype this visually on a canvas — want me to open Pencil?
